Experiences with Fortran 77

Fortran was a very interesting language because it showed me how far programming
languages have come.  It is very strict and the fact that I couldn't declare
more variables after I initialized some was insane.  Overall the language was
not that bad to understand.  It was just pretty tricky considering I had to
start my statements at column 7 and there were no do whiles in Fortran 77.  Once
I got the hang of that, it was pretty straight forward to work through the
assignment.
